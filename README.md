Hi there! I'm a computer science engineering student with a growing passion for coding, especially in Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). This repository serves as a playground for my learning journey, where I experiment and solidify my understanding.

**Currently Exploring:**

* **Java:** Deepening my grasp of core Java concepts, object-oriented programming principles, and building robust applications.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Mastering fundamental algorithms and data structures to tackle complex problems efficiently and elegantly.

**Looking Forward To:**

* **Building Full-Stack Web Applications:** Combining my knowledge of Java, DSA, and potentially frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create comprehensive, user-friendly web experiences.
* **Contributing to Open-Source Projects:** Giving back to the developer community by collaborating on projects that align with my interests and enhance my skills.
